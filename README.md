# Unexpected Node.js Server Crash

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Node.js server crashes unexpectedly without providing any error messages in the console. The server is a simple HTTP server that responds with 'Hello, World!'. The crash is difficult to debug because there are no clear error messages to pinpoint the issue.  The solution provides a more robust error handling mechanism.
